## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- The plugin manifest version and the distribution version are bumped together, so the version
  the plugin card reports matches the installed distribution.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- The CUDA torch index is applied on Windows as well as Linux, so GPU-enabled installs work on
  Windows hosts.

### Changed
- The plugin SDK dependency is resolved from the public package index under its final name
  `3lc-compute-plugin-sdk` (was a git pin).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- PaCMAP and UMAP dimensionality-reduction dependencies (via the `3lc[pacmap,umap]` extras) so
  embedding visualizations work out of the box.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-01

First release, extracted from the `3lc-compute-plugins` umbrella into its own repository.

### Added
- The timm training plugin for the 3LC compute service: fine-tune any of the 1000+ PyTorch Image
  Models on 3LC tables, with per-sample metrics and embeddings collected to 3LC runs. GPU-classed
  and venv-isolated; distributed as `3lc-compute-plugin-timm`.
